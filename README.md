## Introduction

Welcome to this MongoDB and ASP.Net Core Web App workshop.
The workshop focuses on demonstrating how Google Cloud and MongoDB Atlas can work together and integrate effectively. The participants will get hands-on experience with both platforms.
The goal is to provide practical knowledge and ensure participants feel comfortable using these technologies.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo to your local machine
2. Open the project in your IDE of choice
3. Edit appsettings.json and appsettings.Development.json and update the ConnectionString field with your connection string from the 'Connect' button for your cluster in the [Atlas UI](https://cloud.mongodb.com)
4. Run the project and access the swagger endpoint to run all CRUD operations

### Controllers

The MoviesController.cs class is where the routes/endpoints for the api are defined.

Each endpoint calls to a method in the MongoDBService.cs class.

### Services

The MongoDBService.cs class contains the code that uses the MongoDB.Driver NuGet package to carry out CRUD operations against your Cluster.

### Models

The Movie.cs class acts as a model you can use throughout the project and the properties in it, map to the fields in the MongoDB document.

MongoDBSettings.cs contains an interface and implementation that maps to the MongoDB section in appsettings.json and appsettings.Development.json. In this application, the connection string to your cluster is stored here, but normally in production, you would combine this with [user secrets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=windows).

### Project Root

At the root of the project is the usual files that come out of the box with an ASP.NET Core Web App project.

The only file with changes made here is the Program.cs class.
Inside the ConfigureServices method, the appsettings code is pulled in and the Database
settings and Games Service are added to dependency injection for use in other classes.

## Running the code

If your IDE supports it, you can go ahead and run the application from inside the IDE.

If you prefer to run it from your terminal/command-line, you can use `dotnet run`.
